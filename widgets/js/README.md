## File Structure

widgets/
    â”œâ”€â”€ js/

```

 - Each widget has its folder under the js directory, named after the widget's name. Inside each widget folder, there are specific files for the widget implementation:

- `index.html`: This HTML file serves as the main template for the widget.

- `index.js`: The JavaScript file containing the widget's logic and functionality.

- `main.scss`: The main SCSS (Sass) file for styling the widget.

- `package.json`: A JSON file that contains metadata about the widget, such as name, version, dependencies, etc.
